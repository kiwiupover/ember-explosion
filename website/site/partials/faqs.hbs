### Where is the Ember Rodeo being held?

Everywhere! The Ember Rodeo is a virtual worldwide hackathon;
teams of up to four people can compete
from anywhere with an internet connection.
You can build your app while wearing your Ninja Turtles footie pajamas; we won't judge.

### What kind of projects are you looking for?

Everything from innovative user experiences
to an EmberAddon that will increase productivity of ember developers the world over.

### How will the competition work?

If you're familiar with the [Static Showdown](http://staticshowdown.com/), [Rails Rumble](http://railsrumble.com/) or [Node Knockout](http://nodeknockout.com/), like those!
If you're not, teams will register before the competition
and will have 48 hours to write their apps from scratch.
While you can pre-plan what you're going to do,
you can build out any backend api end points you may need,
but you can't create any digital assets (not even logos or other graphics) before the clock starts.
After 48 hours a panel of judges will evaluate the apps
and prizes will be awarded in various categories.

### Who's running this thing and why?

The Ember Rodeo is being put together by the Ember Community.

### How do I participate?

Registration will open April 1st, no joke, sign up and we will notify you when registration opens.
